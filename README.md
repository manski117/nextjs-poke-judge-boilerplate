Currently in development, so hang tight.

## Data sources
Planning on getting rules data from one of these PDFs:
https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/pdf/trading-card-game/rulebook/jtg_rulebook_en.pdf
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/pdf/trading-card-game/rulebook/sm7_rulebook_en.pdf
https://tcg.pokemon.com/assets/img/learn-to-play/getting-started/quick-start-rules/en-us/quick_start_rulebook.pdf
https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms/pdf/tcg/rulebooks/HeartGold_SoulSilver_Rulebook.pdf
(might want to even experiment with these to see which one gets better results)

All compendium rulings will come from [pokegym.net](https://compendium.pokegym.net/all-rulings-by-category/)
